# Customer-Data

# Introduction Overview 

This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments and trends. The goal was to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, 
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable was a Power BI 
dashboard that presented my analysis.

# Tools Used 

# MS Excel

- Duplicates were found in the data and deleted.

- Customer data was analyzed using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
  
- The average subscription duration was calculated using pivot tables and the most popular 
subscription types was identified.

# SQL 

I executed queries to retrieve:

- Retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
  
- Find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
- Find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
- Calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
- Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- Calculate total revenue by subscription type.
- Find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
- Find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.

  # Power BI

  Power BI dashboard was created that visualizes key customer segments, 
cancellations, and subscription trends. Slicers were included for interactive analysis.
